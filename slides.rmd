# Just Enough Microservices
  
## What are Microservices?
- Microservices are

## How do Microservices relate to Containers?

- Containers facilitate the modularized development and deployment of microservices. 
- Using one service per container guarantees independence 

# Containerization

# Containers vs Virtual Machines

## Differences

# Docker

## Definition
Docker is a Platform xxx

# Docker Primitives

## Docker Engine

## Docker Image
- We can think of a Docker Image as a stopped Docker Container
- Each element within an image represents an image layer. Layers are then stacked on top of each other and ready to run. 
- 

## Docker Container
- Containers are the central unit on top of which all Docker is built, and they are better examined practically. 

## Docker Compose

# Docker Demo

## Graylog App
- Graylog is an open source log management solution for capturing, storing, and analyzing machine data. It needs two dependencies:
  - MongoDB: An open-source, “general purpose, document-based, distributed database”
  - Elasticsearch: An open-source, “powerful analytics engine to explore data easily”.

## Docker Run
* ~$ docker container run <options> <image>:<tag> <app> *

### Note
In Ubuntu 20.04 LTS stock, installing graylog requires adjusting default virtual memory settings using: *sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144*
